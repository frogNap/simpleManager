# How do I put this baby to work?
Easy peasy lemon squeezy my friend.

Just fire up a pretty little MySQL instance with the info you can get from the server.js file.
<br>
Then go into the project folder and run:
```sh
$ npm install
$ node server.js
```
Awesome, the server is up and running on localhost:3010 (considering you didn't change the environment variables XD).
